# ImageFaceDetection

Software that allows you detect faces from provided camera via TCP/IP communication protocol
I created this software to be able to take any camera it is given and be able to look through the camera and grab a face detection on it. 

It can work with virtually any camera given, with TCP/IP protocol and a proper internet connection (just insert IP address and store as variable).
